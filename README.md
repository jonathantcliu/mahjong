Mahjong, written in Elm. According to Illinois state law, gambling is illegal unless you're on a river or some body of water or some other legal fiction dreamed up by people with far too much time on their hands. Verifying that the user qualifies for an exception is beyond the scope of the game, so gambling has been disabled to placate state legislators.
